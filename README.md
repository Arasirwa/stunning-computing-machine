# 🎬 Movie Industry EDA — Box Office & Ratings Analysis

📊 **Overview**
This project explores movie industry data to support strategic decision-making for a company entering film production. The goal is to identify genre trends, budget patterns, and viewer preferences that correlate with higher box office success.

---

🧠 **Business Problem**
Your company is branching into the movie business and needs to make informed decisions about what kinds of films to produce. With limited knowledge of the entertainment industry, they rely on your analysis to determine:

* Which genres are most profitable?
* Do higher IMDb ratings equate to higher revenue?
* What’s the ideal budget range to aim for commercial success?

Your task is to translate complex data into actionable insights that guide the studio's production strategy.

---

📌 **Key Questions Answered**

* Which genres consistently earn high box office revenue?
* Do movie ratings correlate with commercial success?
* What budget levels tend to lead to higher returns?
* Are there trends in genre + rating + revenue combinations?
* What strategic budget ranges should the studio target?

---

📁 **Datasets Used**
**Source:**

* [Box Office Mojo Dataset](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDb SQLite Database](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)

**Columns Extracted:**

* `primary_title`, `genre`, `start_year`, `average_rating`, `num_votes`
* `studio`, `domestic_gross`, `worldwide_gross`, `production_budget`

**Data Processing Includes:**

* Cleaning and merging datasets
* Handling missing/null values
* Standardizing genres and years
* Creating visualizable and interpretable formats

---

📊 **Visual Analysis**

This project includes an exploratory notebook with visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

Key visualizations:

* 🎭 **Revenue by Genre** – Understand which genres dominate financially
* 🌟 **Ratings vs Revenue Scatter** – Investigate the rating-profit relationship
* 💵 **Budget vs Revenue** – Visualize return on investment ranges
* 📈 **Trends Over Time** – Optional: Decade-wise performance

---

✅ **Business Recommendations**

* 🎯 **Focus on Action, Adventure, and Animation genres**
  These genres lead in box office performance and are family-friendly or broad-appeal.

* 🎬 **Mid-budget films (\$30M–\$70M) yield best returns**
  Balances risk and reward; avoids the losses of overblown blockbusters.

* 🌟 **Target movies with IMDb ratings ≥ 7.0**
  Though not a guarantee, it's a strong signal of audience approval.

* 📈 **Blend commercial appeal with critical acclaim**
  A movie doesn’t need to win Oscars, but quality storytelling enhances returns.
